##Drupal 8 admin theme symbol library.

This is a collection of symbols for quickly mocking up Drupal web applications, created by Nenad Scuric and released under the GNU General Public License v3.0.


###Getting Started
To use files you will need [sketchapp] (http://www.sketchapp.com/).

###Is Sketch available for Windows or Linux? 

Due to the technologies and frameworks exclusive to OS X that Sketch has been built upon, regrettably we will not be considering supporting Sketch on either of these platforms.
